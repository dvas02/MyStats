# MyStats
An app where you can keep track of all sorts of stats against any criteria

NOTE: As long as this note is here, the app is still under development and may not be fully functional. This app will go onto the Google Play Store and Apple Store once it is finished. Thank you and feel free to add to my work and please make it look nicer if you can, I am by no means a digital artist!!

For example, athletes can keep track of their current best scores or stats on their own and compare them against average players at their skill level. Or, in my case, I like keeping track of places I've visited and this can be easily done through the app and I can also keep track of the percentage of the world I've covered in respect to the number of countries I've visited.
